# tiny-tower

This project intends to recode tiny-tower game engine based on an actor approach.
Since the game is event driven, actor model through message communication provides an interesting programming model.
Akka is just used here for its simplicity to develop actors. Of course, for such game engine, the scalabily
aspect has not been considered.

For more info on the game, please have a look at: https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/tiny-tower-free-city-building/id422667065?mt=8
